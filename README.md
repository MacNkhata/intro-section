## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS
- Flexbox
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

This was the first time to do a React project on my own with following a tutorial. This project was informative and I was able to design the website and add the required functionality to the best of my abilities so far. I will attempt it again in the future when I gain a lot more experience.

### Continued development

From this project I will try other challenges from Frontend Mentor to continue improving my React proficiency and continue more react capabilities. I will also try include Next js in the coming projects.
